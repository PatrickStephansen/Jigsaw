# Jigsaw
A minimal webpage that allows image fragments to be dragged around.

I made this to help me solve one of the tile puzzles in Safecracker. I couldn't see what the goal image was supposed to be, so I wanted to be able to freely move the blocks without the constraints of the puzzle.

jQuery UI's draggable widgets do most of the work.
